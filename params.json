{"name":"Reddit Bots","tagline":"","body":"## What is this?\r\n\r\nRedditBots.com is an open domain for bots that require third-party authentication and/or want a separate web interface (eg. instead of parsing messages/comments).\r\n\r\nBy default, there is a wildcard domain (`*.redditbots.com`) set up to point to Heroku apps, so you can use it for any bots you are running on Heroku, **without having to do anything else**, by running `heroku domains:add example.redditbots.com`.\r\n\r\nHowever, this will be a *direct link* to Heroku (without CloudFlare's performance or HTTPS support), and not all bots are hosted on Heroku. As such, if you have a bot running somewhere else, or if you want full CloudFlare support, you can request a subdomain to point to a specific server / CNAME in the thread at https://www.reddit.com/r/redditbots/comments/332mi7/redditbotscom_subdomain_request_thread/, and /u/StuartPBentley can direct that subdomain of redditbots.com to your bot.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if you are hosting a bot on a local machine from your house, you can set up a [dynamic DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) record for your IP address, then use that as a CNAME for your bot's subdomain.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
